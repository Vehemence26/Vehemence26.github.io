        <h1>TESTIMONIALS</h1>

        <blockquote>I worked with Brendan to create a banner image for my old website, not only did he deliver an impressive image, but he was also super easy to work with.</blockquote>
        <h4> CEO – Holy Cherrys </h4>

        <blockquote>We had used Joomla to create and maintain our website, but after several years, the website’s design had become dated.  We decided to hire Brendan to redesign the website. Brendan set out the revision process with timelines and was really communicative. This made for an easy process and I would highly recommend him to anyone else needing a website.</blockquote>

        <blockquote>Brendan worked on our ERP software as a Javascript developer. He solved a lot of bugs and came up with some great ideas that we were implement throughout out the software. It’s been a privilege.</blockquote>
